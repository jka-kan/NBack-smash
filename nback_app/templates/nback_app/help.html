        <p>NBack Smash is a game based based on so called dual-task n-back which continously
        challenges player's short term memory and concentration. It was introduced by Wayne Kirchner in 1958.</p>

        <p>Several scientific studies have been conducted, some of which claim that not only better memory performance but also increase of IQ and fluid intelligence can be measured on test subjects who have been playing n-back over a certain period of time.
        <i>(For example Li, Zhang, Qiao and others: Dual n-back working memory training evinces superior transfer effects compared to the method of loci, Scientific Report 3072(2021))</i></p>

               
        <p>The player has to constantly update his short term working memory (WM) when new information is received. The dual n-back makes this even more difficult because the player has to store two different types of data in WM.</p>

        
        <p>The game principle is simple. The player is shown a sequence of squares or cubes in 3x3 grid. Places of squares has to be remembered n-amount cycles backwards.</p>
        
        <p>For example, if the numbers 1-9 represent different locations in the grid and n = 2, a random sequence would have these matches marked with parentheses :</p>
        
        3, 4, 4, 5, (4), 1, 9, 6, (9), 5, 5...
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The same applies to sounds played simoultanesly with a different set of matches.</p>

        <p>Most implementations of n-back game use pronounced letters as a sound, but in NBack Smash piano notes are played in different pitches.
        Musical notes are more abstract and probably more difficult to remember, at least to those who don't have musical skills.</p>
        
        <p>At the end, results of the sequence (default 20 cycles) are shown and registered users can review their improvement in form of chart representation.</p>
        
        <p>Compared to other similar games NBack Smash is designed to be more challenging. The player has an option to have visual distractions and the grid can be rotated so that one has to remember positions relatively to grid in stead of thinking sequence as series of "moves". 3D rotation makes the playing even more difficult, because the player momentarily sees the grid from the behind so that he has to think locations as a mirror image. It is possible to speed up the rotation and cycle intervals.</p>
        
        <p>The statistics page shows two types of results:
        - user's right answers divided by the total amount of n-back matches in the sequence
        - score points adjusted with the difficulty level.</p>
        
        <p>The user can change various settings, for instance rotation speed and direction, sequence length, keys used to signal answers, speed of distractions and sound volume.</p>
